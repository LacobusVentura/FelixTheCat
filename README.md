What is a Demo?

A demo is a program that displays a sound, music, and light show, usually in 3D. Demos are very fun to watch, because they seemingly do things that aren't possible on the machine they were programmed on.

Essentially, demos "show off". They do so in usually one, two, or all three of three methods:

    They show off the computer's hardware abilities (3D objects, multi-channel sound, etc.)
    They show off the creative abilities of the demo group (artists, musicians)
    They show off the programmer's abilities (fast 3D shaded polygons, complex motion, etc.)

Demos are an art form. They blend mathematics, programming skill, and creativity into something incredible to watch and listen to.

Grant Smith puts it another way:

	Jonny looks around, confused, his train of thought disrupted. He
	collects himself, and stares at the teacher with a steady eye. "I want
	to code demos," he says, his words becoming stronger and more confidant
	as he speaks. "I want to write something that will change people's
	perception of reality. I want them to walk away from the computer dazed,
	unsure of their footing and eyesight. I want to write something that
	will reach out of the screen and grab them, making heartbeats and
	breathing slow to almost a halt. I want to write something that, when it
	is finished, they are reluctant to leave, knowing that nothing they
	experience that day will be quite as real, as insightful, as good. I
	want to write demos."

	Silence. The class and the teacher stare at Jonny, stunned. It
	is the teachers turn to be confused. Jonny blushes, feeling that
	something more is required.  "Either that or I want to be a fireman."
